# Project & Portfolio 5 Class Project

The goal of this class is develop a project which is added to my personal developer portfolio with the intent of demonstrating my skills and knowledge accrued thus far.

## Project Definition
![moolahlah logo](./src/img/moolahlah_logo.png)

moolahlah is a budgeting application. You enter your income / expenses / debts; then over the timeblock of the budget, you add your expenses. The application tracks your progress.

## Enviornment

The only machine dependency is `Node.js version 7.5.0`. The backend uses the `Firebase` authentication and database service to store user information. Database rules will be defined as I go.

## Tech Stack

__Please see the `package.json` file for dependencies__

## Development

I am using `Webpack 3` to bundle assets and run tasks. _The configuration is custom and no react bootstrap was used._<br>

** Scripts **
```
# Clone the reposition
$bash: git clone https://github.com/mattgreenberg/Portfolio5.git ./moolahlah

# Install Dependencies
$bash: npm install

# Start Development Server
# The server does watch and reload non webpack files.
$bash: npm start

# Build Production Bundle
$bash: npm run build
```
